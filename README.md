# Gap – GASP + GAS Combat Framework (UE5.7)

Project Gap is a Unreal Engine 5 prototype that integrates **Motion Matching (GASP)** with the **Gameplay Ability System (GAS)** to create a TPS Hack & Slash Shooter.

This project focuses on gameplay systems architecture, input-driven abilities, and attribute-driven UI rather than polished game content.
